#My-Portfolio-Version-1.0

## Portfolio

I never fully uploaded this months ago due to my lack of knowledge regarding CSS and how to use it fully. Upon going back I have incorporated more knowledge that I have found and learned over the last few months. I also found a template that I enjoyed and made my own changes to fit my style a bit more. I know I have some more CSS to clean up but overall with the working links and functional email contact I am satisfied for now with this project.
